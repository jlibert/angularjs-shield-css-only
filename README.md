# AngularJS Shield - CSS Only

AngularJS Shield is a part of the AngularJS logo and is [licensed](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/LICENSE) under blah, blah, blah, etc, etc... I am not associated with or endorsed by blah, blah, blah, etc, etc.

Looks great on most browsers, IE doesn't detect the google font used for the "A" in the imagery (don't care that much, maybe a problem for future me or others who want to fork this repo).
